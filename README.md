     Raptor, Pterodactyl, Stegosaurus
~A dino-themed Rock, Paper, Scissors game~
This is a Flask conversion of a simple command line game I made last year. Converting it from the simple, single script

This version has everything from the original except the background music (tricky to do right in a web client) and the instructions (it's just Rock, Paper, Scissors so I didn't bother bringing those over). 

This version also has user accounts with stat tracking, which was fun and tricky to introduce.

This is a `poetry` package. I recommend using `pipx` to install. May update later with more complete install instructions.
